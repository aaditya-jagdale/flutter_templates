# Contribution Guidelines 🛠

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this Flutter Template Repository! 🎉 We're excited to have you on board. To ensure a smooth process and maintain a high quality of templates, please follow these guidelines when submitting your contributions.

---

## General Guidelines 🚀
- **Keep it Simple**: Minimize the number of files and dependencies. Your contribution should be lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects.
- **Clarity**: Make sure your code is well-documented and clean, with meaningful comments where necessary.
- **Testing**: Ensure that your contributions work without errors. Try to test it on multiple devices and environments if possible.

---

## UI Components & Animations 🎨
- **Visual Proof**: Always attach a **screenshot** or **screen recording** showing how the UI component or animation works.
  - You can include these in the pull request description or directly within the repository (under a `screenshots` folder, for example).
- **Simplicity**: Ensure the UI component or animation is kept minimal and does not introduce unnecessary complexity or dependencies.

---

## Backend Integrations 🌐
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: For every backend integration (e.g., API, Firebase, Supabase), include a **separate file** (e.g., `integration_guide.md`) that provides **step-by-step instructions** for the setup and integration.
- **.env Files**: If your integration uses any environment variables:
  - List all required keys and their purposes in your guide.
  - Provide a link to documentation or instructions on **how to obtain the necessary keys**.
  - Ensure these instructions are clear, so others can replicate the setup with ease.

---

## Environment Variables (.env) 🌍
- If any sensitive keys (API keys, authentication tokens, etc.) are required:
  - Mention **what keys are needed** in the `integration_guide.md`.
  - Provide links and instructions on **how to obtain** those keys (e.g., from Firebase, Supabase, etc.).
  - Ensure no sensitive data is hardcoded or exposed in the files.
